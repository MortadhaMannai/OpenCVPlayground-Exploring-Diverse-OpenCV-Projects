# Body Detection Project

The Body Detection project demonstrates the use of computer vision techniques to detect and locate human bodies in images and video streams. This project is implemented using the OpenCV library and showcases the fundamental concepts of object detection and image processing.

## Features

- Human Body Detection: Utilizes the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) algorithm with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to detect human bodies.
- Bounding Box Visualization: Displays bounding boxes around detected human bodies for easy visualization.
- Real-time Processing: Capable of processing video streams in real-time for continuous body detection.
- Adjustable Parameters: Explore the impact of algorithm parameters on accuracy and performance.
