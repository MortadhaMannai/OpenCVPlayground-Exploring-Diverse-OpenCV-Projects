# Hand Written Digits Recognition 
  This is a simple way that shows how we can recognize hand written digits by using the KNN(K Nearest Neighbour)

#### Required Modules :
  - Numpy   
    ```bash
      pip install numpy
    ```
  - Opencv   
    ```bash
      pip install opencv-python
    ```
#### Note :
  Make sure that when you test a given number it must have the same size as the data taken,in other words the digits you give to the KNN and the digits you use to test the KNN must have the same SIZE.
