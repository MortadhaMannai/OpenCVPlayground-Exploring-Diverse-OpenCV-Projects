--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Author: Manai Mortadha

Welcome to the OpenCVPlayground repository! üöÄ


## About

OpenCVPlayground is a repository dedicated to providing a curated collection of exciting OpenCV projects. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn about computer vision or an experienced developer experimenting with image processing techniques, this repository has something for everyone.

Each project is designed to showcase various aspects of OpenCV, including image manipulation, feature detection, object tracking, and more. The projects range in complexity, making it an ideal resource for learners and enthusiasts at all skill levels.

## Projects

Here's a glimpse of what you'll find in this repository:

1. **Project Name**: Body_Detection ( the Body Detection project is an example of computer vision and object detection using the OpenCV library. This project focuses on identifying and locating human bodies within images or video streams. It is a fundamental task in the field of computer vision with applications ranging from surveillance and security to augmented reality.)
 
2. **Project Name**: Face_Eye_Detection (Face and eye detection is a common computer vision task that involves identifying and locating human faces and eyes within images or video streams. It is a popular application of OpenCV, a powerful computer vision library in Python. Here's an overview of how to perform face and eye detection using OpenCV)
   
3. **Project Name**: Hand_Written_digits_recognition (Handwritten digits recognition is the process of using computer algorithms and machine learning techniques to identify and classify handwritten numerical digits. This is a common task in the field of computer vision and machine learning, and it has various practical applications, such as digitizing handwritten documents, automating postal code recognition, and enabling the use of handwritten digits as input for various applications, including digit recognition for authentication purposes.)

4. **Project Name**: Object_Tracking (Object tracking is a computer vision and image processing technique used to locate and follow objects within a sequence of images or video frames. It plays a crucial role in various applications, including surveillance, robotics, self-driving cars, and augmented reality. The goal of object tracking is to continuously identify and monitor the movement of a particular object as it changes position, size, and orientation over time.)

5. **Project Name**: Road_Line_Detection
6. **Project Name**: Screen_Recording
7. **Project Name**: Take_Screenshot
8. **Project Name**: Turn_Your_PC_To_A_Security_Cam
